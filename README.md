# Suttyofogo

It's a very simple application with OpenCV to capture camera images
when movement is detected.

### Why "Suttyofogo"

The repo name is in hungarian because we had to deploy it on a RaspberyPi
with a webcam attached to it to catch a suttyo _(jerk, shit-kicker)_ in
our office.

**suttyó**: vulgar, uncontrolled adolescent.

**fogó**: catcher.
